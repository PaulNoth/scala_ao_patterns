# Exploring Possibilities for Symmetric Implementation of Aspect-Oriented Design Patterns in Scala

**Abstract**

In aspect-oriented programming, 
it may be distinguished between asymmetric and symmetric implementation. 
Aspect-oriented design patterns are known in their AspectJ-like, 
asymmetric implementation. One of their categorization is by dominating element of aspect-oriented programming - 
pointcut patterns, advice patterns and inter-type declaration patterns. 
Scala is a programming language which joins object-oriented and functional paradigm. 
Despite Scala is not fully aspect-oriented, it contains language mechanisms which can implement 
aspect-oriented feature - advice in symmetric way. 
This paper presents three aspect-oriented design patterns. 
We have demonstrated that Cuckoo's Egg and Director described in Coplien's form can be implemented in Scala. 
We have also described Worker Object Creation pattern in similar manner and created an implementation in Scala.
